# Leukemia_disease_project
This project focuses on building a deep learning–based system for automatic detection of Leukemia from microscopic blood smear images. Early and accurate diagnosis of leukemia is critical for effective treatment, and this project demonstrates how modern AI techniques can support medical analysis with high reliability.

# Dataset
The dataset contains 8009 microscopic blood smear images. 
Because of its large size, it cannot be uploaded directly to GitHub.
